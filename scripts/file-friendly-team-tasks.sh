# One-off board seeding for the 2026-09-22 review: "more user friendly like
# Lovable, while also team focused".
#
# This project keeps its tasks in the daemon's SQLite database, so they cannot
# be filed from a checkout alone — run this on a machine whose dispatchd owns
# the board. Delete the file once it has run.
#
# It is safe to re-run: every task is matched by title first and skipped if it
# is already on the board.
#
#   scripts/file-friendly-team-tasks.sh --dry-run   # print what it would file
#   scripts/file-friendly-team-tasks.sh
#
# Tasks that already have epics (preview per run, lens, builder front door) are
# NOT re-filed. Where an existing epic is the right home for new work, the new
# task is parented to it; if that epic is gone, a replacement epic is created.

  e-5f3530 (team-local mode) was filed blocked by e-99e113 (storage spine).
  The spine has landed, so that blocker is stale. `dispatch task edit` can add
  blockers but not remove them — clear it in the app.
