// Which headers cross the preview proxy, in each direction.
//
// A preview is a dev server running out of a run's worktree — code an agent
// just wrote. The proxy sits between it and a browser that holds the daemon's
// credentials, so it must pass through what a page needs to render and
// nothing that would let that code act as, or unseat, the person viewing it.

// Hop-by-hop headers, which belong to one connection and must not be
// forwarded to or from an upstream (RFC 9110 7.6.1). Forwarding
// `connection`/`upgrade` in particular makes Bun's fetch reject the request.

// Every cookie the daemon sets is named with this prefix — the session, and
// each preview's own capability. Cookies are scoped to a host, not a port, so
// all of them reach the preview's port too, and a Set-Cookie from a preview
// lands in the daemon's jar.
