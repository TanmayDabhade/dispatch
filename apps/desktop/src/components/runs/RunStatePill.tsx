 * Which state color each `RunState` paints with, as a `FeedState` so this pill and the dense
 * surfaces that group by state can never disagree about what "waiting on you" looks like. The
 * colors themselves are the `--state-*` tokens in styles/tokens.css.
 *
 * One row differs from `deriveFeedState` on purpose: `cancelled` is neutral here, not a
 * failure. The two answer different questions. The Control room asks "does a human owe this
 * something", and a cancelled run does — so it groups with failures there. This pill only
 * reports where the process ended, and a run the user deliberately stopped is not an error;
 * painting it red would claim something broke.

 *
 * Takes the whole `RunMeta` rather than just `state` because `RunState` alone cannot say what
 * a run needs from a human: two runs on `finished` differ on whether anyone reviewed them, and
 * two on `failed` differ on whether a session remains to continue from. The disposition pill
 * beside the state answers that (see `deriveRunDisposition`), and deriving it here rather than
 * at each call site is what keeps every surface agreeing — a run reading "Needs review" in
 * the Runs rail but bare "Finished" on a board card is exactly the inconsistency this exists
